# SHARE.com
When going through a rough patch or unsure of the direction God is taking you, hearing or reading a testimony from someone can be quite reassuring. Testimonies from believers are very power tools that can be used to win souls for the kingdom of God as well as encourage a person slipping off.

Share.com is a platform that allows users to share their testimonies as well as serve as a sort of repository or 'safe place' for testimonies. Visitors of the site can go through the testimonies of others and be encouraged.
